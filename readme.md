# Reflow


Reflow is Blender addon that lets you change the fps in a scene.
Instead of using time remapping, Reflow changes the animation data.
It offsets keyframes, markers and fixes NLA lenghts and the scene's endframe.

Time remapping makes timeline scrubbing weird and animations get cut because the
frame's end isn't updated. Changing the keyframes is more "permanent" but avoids
the wonkyness.


## Installing

1. Open Blender's User Preferences (from the File menu or using Ctrl+Alt+U)
2. In the Addons tab, click the Install from File button at the bottom and select the zip you downloaded.
3. Now click the check the box next to the right of the addon to enable it, and click "Save user preferences" to make sure it's always enabled.
